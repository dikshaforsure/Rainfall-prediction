# Rainfall-prediction
Rainfall prediction using ML models with weather data &amp; Streamlit app for real-time forecasts.

This project predicts the probability of rainfall based on weather parameters such as pressure, temperature, dew point, humidity, cloud cover, sunshine, wind direction, and wind speed. It combines data preprocessing, multiple ML models, and an interactive Streamlit frontend for real-time predictions.

📊 Features

Data preprocessing with StandardScaler and RandomOverSampler (to fix imbalance).

Models trained: Logistic Regression, XGBoost, SVM (RBF kernel).

Evaluation using ROC-AUC score for robust performance.

Interactive Streamlit web app for real-time weather input.

Probability chart & predictions (🌧️ Rain / ☀️ No Rain).
